# WCMS PHP Application

Welcome to my project, the WCMS PHP Application! This project aims to develop a content management system (CMS) to efficiently store, generate, distribute, and organize website content. Below, you'll find all the necessary information to understand and utilize this application effectively.

## Introduction

The WCMS PHP Application addresses the need for a web content management system to simplify website content management and administration tasks. By utilizing PHP and MySQL, it provides a robust solution for storing and managing website content dynamically.

## Scope of the Project

The project is divided into two main scopes:
1. Admin Panel (CMS): Includes a database and a web interface for administrators to manipulate the content stored in the database.
2. Website: Consists of templates to dynamically display the content stored in the database.

## Implementation

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

The implementation follows the MVC design pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability.
- **Model**: Handles data manipulation and database interactions.
- **View**: Presents the user interface and displays data retrieved from the database.
- **Controller**: Manages user interactions, routes requests, and interacts with models and views.

### Database

All content is stored in the database, which is accessed and manipulated through the CMS web interface.

### Website Pages

The website consists of the following pages:
- Home: Featuring a slider, welcome text, team section, services, portfolio, and footer.
- About: Displaying text, team information, and services.
- Contact: Providing contact information, social media links, and a contact form.

### Admin Panel

1. **Users**: Administering user accounts with name, email, username, password, and access level (admin or moderator).
2. **Pages**: Managing content pages such as home, about, contact, team, portfolio, and services.

## Requirements

- HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, OOP knowledge.
- Familiarity with MVC design pattern.
- Design and implementation of database schema.
- Implementation of user interface using W3C Standard compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
